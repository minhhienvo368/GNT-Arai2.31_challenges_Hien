# GNT-Arai2.31_challenges_Hien

This is my assignment submition repo for the Becode AI Bootcampt courses.

My challenges is about accomplishing some of interesting challenges from bunch of assignment in Python_challenges folder.

I selected Pangram (dealing with string), Binary (with numeric), Space Age(calculation and OOP) challenges.

1. Determine if a sentence is a pangram. Pangram is defined as a sentence using every letter of the alphabet at least once.
The best known English pangram is "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
2. Binary: Write a program that will convert a binary number, represented as a string (e.g. '101010'), to its decimal equivalent using first principles
3. SpaceAge: Given an age in seconds, calculate how old someone would be on Earth, Mercury, Venus, etc.
The solutions can be found in this folder as Notebook files (.ipynb) or also can be found in the folder of challenges as Python files (.py)
