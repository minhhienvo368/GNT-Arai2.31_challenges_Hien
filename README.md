# GNT-Arai2.31_challenges_Hien

This is my first assignment submission for the Becode AI Bootcamp, the assignment is about creating Functions and Classes in OOP environment. 

I selected Pangram (dealing with strings), Binary (with numerical data), Space Age(calculation and OOP) challenges.

1. Determine if a sentence is a pangram. Pangram is defined as a sentence using every letter of the alphabet at least once.
The best known English pangram is "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
2. Binary: Write a program that will convert a binary number, represented as a string (e.g. '101010'), to its decimal equivalent using first principles
3. SpaceAge: Given an age in seconds, calculate how old someone would be on Earth, Mercury, Venus, etc.

The solutions can be found in this folder as Notebook files (.ipynb) or also can be found in the folder of challenges as Python files (.py)
