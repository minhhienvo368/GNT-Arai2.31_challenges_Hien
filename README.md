# GNT-Arai2.31_challenges_Hien

This is my assignment submition repo for the Becode AI Bootcampt courses.

My challenges is about determining if a sentence is a pangram. A pangram (Greek: παν γράμμα, pan gramma,
"every letter") is a sentence using every letter of the alphabet at least once.
The best known English pangram is "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
